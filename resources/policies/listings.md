# Listings

## What Is a Listing
A listing represents an offer by a host to provide a defined amount of stored energy within a specific time window and transfer method.

## Required Listing Information
Each listing must specify:
- Energy amount (kWh)
- Availability window
- Transfer method (grid feed-in, local battery bank, or direct transfer)
- Price or point requirement
- Applicable station or location (if any)

## Host Responsibilities
Hosts are responsible for:
- Ensuring the advertised energy is available
- Complying with station, grid, and safety requirements
- Updating or canceling listings if availability changes

## Listing Availability
Listings may become unavailable due to:
- Energy depletion
- Station constraints
- System maintenance
- Host cancellation

The platform considers listings non-binding until a transfer is confirmed.

## Platform Review
The platform reserves the right to suspend or remove listings that:
- Contain inaccurate information
- Violate safety or regulatory guidelines
- Generate repeated disputes or failed transfers
