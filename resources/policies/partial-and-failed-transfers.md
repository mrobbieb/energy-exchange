# Partial and Failed Transfers

## Partial Transfers
A partial transfer occurs when some, but not all, of the expected energy amount is delivered.

Common causes include:
- Equipment limitations
- Unexpected load changes
- Safety cutoffs
- Time window expiration

## Handling Partial Transfers
When a partial transfer occurs:
- Delivered energy may be prorated in points
- Undelivered energy may be refunded in points
- Platform or station fees may still apply

The exact adjustment depends on the delivery percentage and system verification.

## Failed Transfers
A failed transfer occurs when no meaningful energy delivery takes place.

## Handling Failed Transfers
Failed transfers may result in:
- Full point refund to the guest
- No points credited to the host
- Logging of the failure reason

Repeated failed transfers may impact host or guest standing.
