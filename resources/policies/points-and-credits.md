# Points and Credits

## Overview
The Energy Exchange platform uses a points-based credit system to represent units of transferable energy value. Points are used to facilitate transactions between hosts and guests and do not represent a direct claim on cash or currency.

## Earning Points
Hosts may earn points by:
- Successfully completing an energy transfer
- Making energy available during high-demand periods
- Participating in pilot programs or promotional initiatives

Points are credited only after a transfer is confirmed as completed.

## Spending Points
Guests may spend points to:
- Reserve energy listings
- Complete energy transfers
- Offset certain platform or station fees where allowed

Point requirements are displayed prior to confirming a transaction.

## Point Valuation
Points are a platform-defined unit of value. The platform may adjust point-to-energy ratios, fees, or incentives over time. No fixed cash equivalency is guaranteed.

## Expiration
Points may expire after a period of inactivity. Expiration rules, if applicable, will be disclosed in advance within the application.

## Refunds and Adjustments
In the event of a cancellation or failed transfer, points may be:
- Fully refunded
- Partially refunded
- Retained as a cancellation fee

Refund behavior depends on timing, transfer method, and station rules.
