# Energy Transfers

## Transfer Overview
An energy transfer is the process by which energy is delivered from a host to a guest using an approved method.

## Transfer Methods
Supported methods may include:
- Grid feed-in via a grid-tied inverter
- Localized battery bank transfer
- Direct peer-to-peer energy transfer (where supported)

Availability of methods depends on location, equipment, and station rules.

## Confirmation of Completion
A transfer is considered complete when:
- The required energy amount is delivered or confirmed
- Both parties acknowledge completion, or
- Automated system verification succeeds

## Failed Transfers
Transfers may fail due to:
- Equipment malfunction
- Insufficient energy
- Network or station issues
- Safety cutoffs

Failed transfers may result in partial or full refunds depending on circumstances.

## Measurement and Accuracy
Energy measurements are provided on a best-effort basis using available metering systems. Minor discrepancies may occur.
