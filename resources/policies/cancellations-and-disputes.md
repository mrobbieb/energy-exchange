# Cancellations and Disputes

## Guest Cancellations
Guests may cancel a transfer prior to completion. Refund eligibility depends on:
- Time remaining before the scheduled transfer
- Whether energy was already reserved or delivered
- Station-specific rules

## Host Cancellations
Hosts may cancel listings or transfers due to:
- Equipment failure
- Safety concerns
- Unexpected energy constraints

Repeated host cancellations may result in account restrictions.

## Dispute Resolution
If a dispute arises, the platform may:
- Review transaction logs and confirmations
- Request information from both parties
- Issue point adjustments at its discretion

## Platform Role
The platform acts as a facilitator and does not guarantee outcomes. Decisions are made based on available data and good-faith assessment.
