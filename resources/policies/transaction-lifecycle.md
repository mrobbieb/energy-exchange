# Transaction Lifecycle

## Overview
A transaction represents a single attempt to transfer energy from a host to a guest using an approved transfer method.

Each transaction progresses through defined stages to ensure clarity, accountability, and traceability.

## Transaction Stages
1. **Initiated**
   - A guest selects a listing and confirms intent to transfer.
   - Points or credits may be temporarily reserved.

2. **Scheduled**
   - A transfer window and method are confirmed.
   - The host is expected to prepare the required energy and equipment.

3. **In Progress**
   - Energy transfer has begun.
   - Metering or system monitoring may be active.

4. **Completed**
   - The required energy amount is delivered or confirmed.
   - Points are finalized and credited to the host.

5. **Failed**
   - The transfer could not be completed.
   - Failure reason is recorded.

6. **Cancelled**
   - The transaction was cancelled by the host or guest before completion.

## Finality
Once a transaction is marked as completed, it is considered final unless a dispute is opened.
