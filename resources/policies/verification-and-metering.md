# Verification and Metering

## Energy Measurement
Energy delivery is measured using available metering systems, which may include:
- Grid-tied inverter readings
- Local battery bank monitoring
- Station-provided meters
- Device-reported telemetry

## Accuracy and Tolerance
Measurements are provided on a best-effort basis.
Minor discrepancies may occur due to:
- Equipment variance
- Sampling intervals
- Communication delays

## Verification Methods
A transfer may be verified through:
- Automated system confirmation
- Host and guest acknowledgment
- Station or operator confirmation

The platform may rely on one or more methods depending on availability.
