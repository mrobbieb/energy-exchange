# Battery Types: LiFePO₄ vs AGM

## Summary
- LiFePO₄ (lithium iron phosphate) typically offers higher usable capacity and longer cycle life than AGM, but needs a compatible charger profile and a BMS.
- AGM is simpler and often cheaper upfront, but typically has lower usable depth-of-discharge and shorter cycle life.

## Usable Capacity
- AGM is commonly limited to ~50% usable capacity if you want good longevity.
- LiFePO₄ is commonly used at higher depth-of-discharge.

## Charging & Compatibility
- LiFePO₄ usually requires a charger/inverter/alternator setup that supports a lithium profile (or configurable voltages) and temperature considerations.
- AGM uses standard lead-acid profiles.

## Cold Temperature Considerations
- Some LiFePO₄ systems restrict charging in freezing temperatures unless heated or otherwise protected.

## Safety / Protection
- LiFePO₄ packs typically rely on a BMS for protection (over/under-voltage, current, temperature).
- AGM safety concerns include venting under fault/overcharge conditions.
